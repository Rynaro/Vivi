## ECL v2.0

This Eidolon targets ECL v2.0 (see `ECL_VERSION`). Three emit kinds:

- `vivi-completion-report` (to IDG, Implement-phase exit, `templates/vivi-completion-report.envelope.json`)
- `repair-failed-report` (to VIGIL, Reflect-phase 3-failure escalation, `templates/repair-failed-report.envelope.json`)
- `reasoning-request` (to FORGE, Plan-phase consultation, `templates/reasoning-request.envelope.json`)

Inbound envelope verification is opt-in and warn-only — see `skills/verify-incoming.md`.

## Consumer project usage

After installing this Eidolon into a consumer project, Claude Code finds the installed agent at `.eidolons/vivi/agent.md`.

To install:

```bash
bash install.sh --hosts claude-code --target ./.eidolons/vivi
```

Claude Code will load `.eidolons/vivi/agent.md` via the `@` pointer added to the consumer's `CLAUDE.md`.

See `INSTALL.md` for full installation instructions and `hosts/claude-code.md` for Claude Code-specific wiring details.
